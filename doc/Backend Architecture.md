# Notes

- Autogenerated id for clients is unnecessary since the username field for general users act as a primary key.
- Wallet name and address when making a deposit is redundant since the client only has 2 wallets, it is simpler to have a selector.
- The QR code and admin account address should be displayed only once in a corner, not in all the registers.
- Asking for passwords in an emergent window is unnecessary and could affect the compatibility.
- There is a problem with the date validation, there is a case when initially the investment period is accepted (it matches the package condition), but the admin does not approve it early so when it starts to count it does not meet the package requirements.
- Is the revenue fixed or compound? the interest rate is applied to the initial amount or the current?
- do the categories have fixed values?
- In the end, the user can edit all the profile information, right?
